The objective of this project was to create basic functions to be used as fundamentals for more advanced projects. This includes the basics of data structures.

This project was possible thanks to the help of my colleagues at 42, especially joaorodrigues3099 and IanToujou with some of their functions. I used automated testers like Normino, Warmachine, and Tripouille.
AIs used as assistants: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Phind.
