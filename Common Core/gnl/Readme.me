This project aims at reading the first line from a text file until it reaches a line break ("\n") each time the function is used. It can also be used to read multiple line breaks until the last one because of the use of a static variable.

I thank joaorodrigues3099 for inspiring me for writing the code, as I followed essentially the same logic of his code. 
This project received help from chatGPT (42 Peer: code pilot and GPT-4o) and Phind, to understand key concepts and to debug.
