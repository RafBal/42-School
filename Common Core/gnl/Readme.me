This project aims at first reading a line from a text file until it reaches a line break ("\n") each time the function is read. 

I thank joaorodrigues3099 for inspiring me for writing the code, as I followed essentially the same logic of his code. 
This project received help from chatGPT (42 Peer: code pilot and GPT-4o) and Phind, to understand key concepts and to debug.
