This project is about the communication between a server program and a client program. Ideally, each one should be run
in different terminal windows to visualize the "conversation" between both. The client sends a message and then the 
server prints it. For the bonus part, the client explicitly recognizes the fact that the message was successfully 
sent to the server.

This project was created with the help of chatgpt and colleagues from the school.
