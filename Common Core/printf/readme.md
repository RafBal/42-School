The objective of this project was to recreate the printf functions. As no bonus were made, I just replicated the printf function to print the following variable types cspdiux%:
c for characters;

s for strings;

p for pointers;

d and i for integers;

u for unsigned integers (naturals);

x for hexadecimals;

X for capital hexadecimals;

% for percentage;

This project was possible thanks to the help of my colleagues at 42, especially joaorodrigues3099 and IanToujou with some of their functions. I used automated testers like Normino.
AIs used as assistants: ChatGPT and Phind.
