I was thinking about another function to execute the moves of push swap following the mechanical turk algorithm:

Let num_a be the number that represents the content of the top node from stack a.
The algorithm is along these lines:
Be a and b stacks a and b, respectively.
if(num_a < min((b.content) || (num_a > max(b.content)) // it should compare with the content of all numbers of stack b
{
while ((*b)->top->content  != max_num_b) // while the the top content of b is not the maximum
{
if ((*b)->top->next->content == max_num_b)
