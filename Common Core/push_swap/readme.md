The objective of this project is to use two stacks to sort a list of numbers introduced by the user, 
either one by one or in a single string with each one of them separated by space in the terminal.

The stacks are data structures composed by lists, with each stack having one list to represent the numbers sequence. 
The stacks use push and swap operations to change the numbers positions.

The algorithms used for this project were bubble sort (for data simplification) and radix sort (for the actual sorting).
